<h3>Different Types of Ad Servers</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">There are additional ad servers that Vidiun supports, 
which are a bit more complex than just plugins. For example, Vidiun is now 
fully integrated with<b> DoubleClick and Freewheel</b>. Their<span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'; COLOR: black"> </span>integrations 
are more complex since there is a server-side connector that allows you to 
define the metadata to submit to the ad server for ad targeting purposes. The 
Vidiun metadata gets mapped to ad serverâ€™s metadata. Then, just like with a 
distribution module, see <a class="topic-link" href="vidiundistributionm.htm">Vidiun Distribution Module</a>, when a Vidiun 
partner wants an entry to be included in the ad server, it is marked as such in 
the VMC. The ad server connector passes all of the metadata to the ad server, 
where the Vidiun partner can then decide how ads should be targeted based on 
the metadata.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Vidiun Player Additions Related to Ads</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If a Vidiun partner wants to create their own type of ad 
targeting and prevent pre-rolls from playing on specific entries, they can 
utilize the <span class="Monospace">flashVar vast.preSequence=0</span>, defined in 
the embed code in the additional parameters and plugins.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Advanced functionality is enabled to provide for a better 
workflow of ad plugins. The Vidiun Player build its UI only when the plugin is 
completely ready, enabling for a smooth loading of player and plugin together 
after the plugin is ready.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
