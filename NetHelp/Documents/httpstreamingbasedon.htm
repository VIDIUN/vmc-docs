(Based on Akamai’s Technology) </h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span class="BodyTextChar">Akamai's advanced adaptive bitrate 
streaming technology intelligently adjusts the bit rate of a video stream to 
ensure the optimum playback quality based on changing bandwidth conditions. It 
also allows for flavor switching without the loss of content. You can send 
streaming video over HTTP from an ordinary web server for playback on iPhone and 
iPad, or other devices, such as desktop computers, without the limitations of 
Progressive Downloads. An optional feature with this selected delivery setting 
is that the implementation also provides for media encryption and user 
authentication over HTTPS, allowing publishers to protect their work.The Akamai 
HD Network is designed and optimized for large-scale broadcasters and film 
distributors to increase audience engagement and expand revenues by 
complementing traditional mediums such as TV and DVD with the 
Internet.</span></p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
