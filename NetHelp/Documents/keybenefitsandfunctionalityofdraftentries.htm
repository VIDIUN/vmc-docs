<h3>Key Benefits and Functionality of Draft Entries</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">You can prepare a new media entry in the VMC and set its 
metadata and publishing information beforehand, or in parallel, to the actual 
media processing and then add the media files to the existing entry when 
ready.  </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This flexibility may be of value especially with large 
media operational teams, when the metadata preparation effort is separated from 
the media preparation effort with different teams working on each 
operation.  Separating these tasks, may provide more efficiency to the 
company’s internal processes as editing metadata can be done without dependency 
on the media preparation operation.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">When you prepare a No Media entry in the VMC you can upload 
the media file/s to Vidiun at a later time either by uploading the source for 
transcoding in Vidiun or uploading <span class="BodyTextChar">media assets/files 
that have already been generated locally using your own transcoder</span>. </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Note that the option to use a local transcoder to ingest 
flavors is a feature that is not enabled by default. Contact your Vidiun 
account manager to learn more about how this feature can simplify your workflow, 
and to activate and configure this feature on your account.</p><span id="related-topics"></span></body></html>
